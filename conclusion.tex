\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we investigate the noise problem inherent in  the \DS-style training data.
 We argue that the data speak for themselves by providing useful clues to reveal their noise patterns.
We thus propose a novel transition matrix based method to dynamically characterize the noise underlying such training data in a unified framework along  the original prediction objective.
One of our key innovations is to exploit a curriculum learning based training method to gradually  learn to model  the underlying noise pattern without direct guidance, and to provide the flexibility to exploit any prior knowledge of the data quality to further improve the effectiveness of the transition matrix.
We evaluate our approach in two learning settings of the distantly supervised relation extraction. The experimental results show
that the proposed method can better characterize the underlying noise and consistently outperform start-of-the-art extraction models under various scenarios.

%Currently, our noise modeling branch is relatively independent  with respect to the normal prediction branch.  which
