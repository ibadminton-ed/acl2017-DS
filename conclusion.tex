\section{Conclusion}
\todo{re-write}
In this paper, we propose that the input data may contain useful clues that indicate the noise pattern introduced by distant supervision. We therefore propose to model the noise by dynamically generating a transition matrix for each training data. To overcome the lack direct guidance over the noise pattern, we propose to use curriculum learning to model the noise gradually and trace regularization to help control the behavior of the transition matrix. The experiments on two datasets show that our transition matrix method improves both the sentence level and bag level model in the situation with and without prior knowledge of data quality. We also find that the prior knowledge of data quality can help the training of the transition matrix.
