Distant supervision significantly reduces human efforts in constructing training data for many classification tasks, however, it inevitably introduces noise into the dataset. In this paper, we take a deep look at the application of distant supervision in relation extraction. We investigate the underlying noise in the training data, and propose to utilize constrained dynamic transition matrices to model the noise. We also take the advantage of curriculum learning to explore possible clues of the noise patterns, and further improve the model robustness. We experiment our models with both sentence level and bag level in the situations with and without prior knowledge of data quality. The experimental results show that our method can better handle the noise in distantly supervised relation extraction and improve extraction performance in various settings.
