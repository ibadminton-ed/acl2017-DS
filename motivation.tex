\section{Motivation}
\todo{ZW: We need a concrete example here to demonstrate what kind of noise can exist in the data and their impact on relation extraction. We then use this example to explain our approach.}
\blue{F: this could be put into the introduction, saying different types of noises in the data, and all thoses noises can be modeled by TM. }

As a motivation example, consider xx...

This example shows that noisy data can have a significant impact on relation extraction. What we like to have is a technique that can xxx.
In the remainder of this paper, we describe such an approach based on xxx.
