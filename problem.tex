\section{Problem Definition}
The task of distantly supervised relation extraction is to extract knowledge triples, $<$\emph{subj}, \texttt{rel}, \emph{obj}$>$, from free text with the training data constructed by aligning existing \KB triples with a large corpus.
Specifically, given a triple in \KB, \DS works by first retrieving all the sentences containing both \emph{subj} and \emph{obj} of the triple, and then constructing the training data by considering these sentences as support to the existence of the triple.
This task can be conducted in both the sentence and the bag levels.
The former  takes a sentence $s$ containing both $subj$ and $obj$ as input, and outputs the relation expressed
by the sentence between $subj$ and $obj$.
The latter setting
alleviates the noisy data problem by using the \textit{\textbf{at-least-one assumption}}
% is based on the \textit{\textbf{at-least-one assumption}}
that at least one of the retrieved sentences containing both $subj$ and $obj$ supports the $<$\emph{subj}, \texttt{rel}, \emph{obj}$>$ triple.
It takes a bag of sentences $S$ as input where each sentence
$s\in S$ contains both $subj$ and
$obj$, and outputs  the relation between $subj$ and $obj$ expressed by this bag.

%Distantly supervised relation extraction aims at extracting $<$ $subj$,  $rel$,  $obj$ $>$ triples from free text using distantly obtained training data, which can be examined in two different settings, i.e., sentence level, and bag level. The former  takes a sentence $s$ containing both $subj$ and $obj$ as input, and output the relation expressed by the sentence between $subj$ and $obj$. The latter setting is based on the \textit{at-least-one} assumption (\todo{explain the assumption if not explained before}) and takes a bag of sentences $S$ as input where each sentence $s\in S$ contains both $subj$ and $obj$, and output  the relation expressed by the sentence bag between $subj$ and $obj$.
